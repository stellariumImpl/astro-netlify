Hi there, and welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm Felix Fan, a tech enthusiast with a passion for data science and engineering. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in IT at the University of New South Wales.

Outside of coding and crunching data, you'll probably find me on the badminton court, enjoying a good game.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”hope you have a great time here! ðŸš€
